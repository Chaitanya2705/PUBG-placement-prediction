# PUBG-placement-prediction

Dataset and competition can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction

The team at PUBG has made official game data available for the public to explore and scavenge outside of "The Blue Circle." This competition is not an official or affiliated PUBG site - Kaggle collected data made possible through the PUBG Developer API.

You are given over 65,000 games' worth of anonymized player data, split into training and testing sets, and asked to predict final placement from final in-game stats and initial player ratings.

Implemented using the LightGBM model on the Kaggle terminal.
